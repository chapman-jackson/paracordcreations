        Parachute cord is a nylon rope that was originally used for parachutes. It has practical uses in camping, and it is also used in crafts.
        
        The basic tools you need to make parachute cord projects are scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, and a lighter. The ruler or measuring tape and the scissors are for measuring and cutting the parachute cord down to size, and the lighter is used to melt the end of the parachute cord to prevent fraying.
        
        If you want to improve the quality of your work, there are more specialized tools to accomplish that. Hemostats, or needle nose pliers, are useful for pulling the end of parachute cord through tight spaces. Hemostats also lock in place so you can hold multiple ends of parachute cord together. A marlin spike is used to apply more leverage when untying tight knots or untangling a piece of parachute cord. A fid is a needle with a threaded hole on the back that is used for tying more complex projects or pulling parachute cord through tight spaces.

      <h3>Knot Tying</h3>
      <p>
        This page contains reference materials and links to tutorials from content creators on how to tie knots.

        The cobra knot is a very popular knot for crafts. It is often used for making bracelets and lanyards. It can be tied with one single parachute cord color or two if you melt the ends of the parachute cord together.

        The snake knot is another popular knot for crafts. It is mostly used for making lanyards. It can be tied with one single parachute cord color or two if you melt the ends of the parachute cord together.

        The diamond knot is used as a stopper knot so the ends of a rope will not fall out of a hole or loop. It is also used as a decorative knot to finish the ends of  lanyards.

        The cow's hitch knot is used to attach a piece of parachute cord to a buckle or a clasp.

        The constrictor knot is used to securely bind things to each other. Once you tighten it around an object, it is nearly impossible to untie. Do not use the knot on limbs or other body parts or blood flow to the area will be cut off.

        The bowline knot is used to create a secure loop when rescuing a person. When practiced enough, it can be tied quickly with one hand, which can be life-saving if a victim has an injured arm or time is of the essence. The knot is also useful for any situation where a secure loop of rope is needed. The knot  is easy to untie, even when it is tightened.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This page contains reference materials and links to tutorials from content creators on how to tie some projects with parachute cord using the knots you used from the Knot Tying page.

        The cobra bracelet is one of the best projects to make when starting out with tying projects. They can be used as friendship bracelets or personal jewelry. Depending on wrist size, a bracelet can hold between six and twelve feet of parachute cord, which can be untied and used in an emergency.

        This cobra lanyard is a useful project to make since it has a loop for you to securely hold a set of keys or whatever item you attach it to.

        The ocean plait knot is suitable for more experienced knot tyers, due to the complex nature of how it is tied. Even though this project is difficult, it can be a great decorative piece or a pot holder if you make it larger. It can also be sized accordingly to make a mat or a small rug.
