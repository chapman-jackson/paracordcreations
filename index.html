                <h1>Quick introduction to parachute cord.</h1>

                <p>
                    Parachute cord is a nylon rope that was originally used for parachutes.
                    It has practical uses in camping and it is also used in crafts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic tools you need to make successful crafts are scissors, a ruler or measuring tape, and a lighter.
                    The ruler or measuring tape and the scissors are for measuring and cutting the parachute cord down to size and the lighter is used to melt the end of the parachute cord to prevent fraying.

                <p>
                    If you want to improve the quality of your work, there are more specialized tools accomplish that.
                    Hemostats or needle nose pliers are useful for pulling the end of parachute cord through tight spaces.
                    Hemostats also lock in place so you can hold multiple ends of parachute cord together.
                    A marlin spike is used to apply more leverage when untying tight knots or untangling a piece of parachute cord.
                    A fid is a needle with a threaded hole on the back that is used for tying more complex projects or pulling parachute cord through tight spaces.
